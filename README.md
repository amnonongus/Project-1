**Technologies Used**: Includes HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

**Getting Started**: https://amnonongus.github.io/Project-1/ Click the play button. You have 5 seconds to whaqk all of the ducks on the screen.

**Next Steps**: Future versions of the game will include animated birds that move dynamically, with randomly generated spawn points. Ducks will stay on the screen for a small increment of time before disappearing and a score will be tallied, with leaderboards tracking best performers.
